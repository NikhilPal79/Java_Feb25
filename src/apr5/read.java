    /// SET ===> it is also the data structure.

    /// Data Structure
    // 1. stores unique values
    // 2. does not have order
    // 3. can have null but just.

///  MARKER INTERFACE ===> that interface without anything inside, it just mark the class

///  SERIALIZATION =====> when you convert your object to bite stream and bite stream to object.



/// SET

/// 1. HashSet ==========> RANDOM ORDER, ALLOW THE NULL ELEMENT.
/// 2. TreeSet ==========> NATURAL SORTING ORDER,NO NULL IS ALLOWED
/// 3. LinkedHashSet ====> ORDER IS MAINTAINED INSERTION ORDER


/// NOTE ==> EVERY SINGLE NODE OF ARRAY LIST HAS A LINKED LIST

/*Big O Notation is a metric for determining the efficiency of an algorithm.
It allows you to estimate how long your code will run on different sets of inputs and
measure how effectively your code scales as the size of your input increases.*/

// Big O notation measures the efficiency and performance of your algorithm using time and space complexity.

///  TIME COMPLEXITY ???

// An algorithm's time complexity specifies how long it will take to execute an algorithm as a function of its input size.

///  SPACE COMPLEXITY ???

// Similarly, an algorithm's space complexity specifies the total amount of space or memory required to execute an algorithm
// as a function of the size of the input.
