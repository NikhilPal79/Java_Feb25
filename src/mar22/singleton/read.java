        // A S-class in Java is a class that allows only one instance to be created and provides a global point of access to that instance.
        // It is commonly used to control access to shared resources, such as database connections, logging, or configurations.

        ///Steps to Create a Singleton Class in Java

        //Make the constructor private – Prevents direct instantiation.
        //Create a private static instance variable – Holds the single instance.
        //Provide a public static method – Returns the instance.
