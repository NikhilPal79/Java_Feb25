    ///  GENERICS
/// denoted by <_>
    // Introduced to have type-safety in Java collections.

    ///  WHAT IS TYPE-SAFETY ?

    // Type safety means that a program prevents type errors at compile time by ensuring that variables,
    // methods, and data structures only hold and operate on the correct types.

    // Java is a statically typed language, meaning that type checking happens at compile time rather than runtime,
    // reducing unexpected errors.

    /// what is meant by Generic? advantage of using generics

    // Type safety
    // Flexibility of choosing a collection type/object type

    ///  ex -> see ontario class
