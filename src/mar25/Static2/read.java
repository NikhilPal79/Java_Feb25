    /// Static??

    // In Java, the static keyword is used to indicate that a method, variable, block, or nested class belongs to the class itself
    // rather than instances of the class. This means:

    // 1. A static member can be accessed without creating an object of the class.
    // 2. A static member is shared among all instances of the class.

    //variable
    //method
    //class
    //block
}
