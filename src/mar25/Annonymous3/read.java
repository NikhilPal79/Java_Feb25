    // We use anonymous class to implement interface with one or two method and
    // we don't want to create separate class. -- By using Anonymous class we can also implement Abstract Class. --
    // Created by new keyword following Interface/class name. -- Java 8 Lambda - does not have name -- Lambda - AWS - serverless server

    /// Note : We can create Inner class in Anonymous class but problem is that, when try to access the members of
    /// Inner class we need to create object of inner class (either by Local inner class method/ Static Inner Class),
    /// but we don't have Outer class name as Outer class is Anonymous. So we can create Inner class in method of Anonymous class.

    // We can create the class inside method as well
