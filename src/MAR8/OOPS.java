    /*

    something which can be inherited from previous generation

    Iphone X  - Face id, iOS - [features - abc] , calculator, calls
    imesssage , findMyLocation, Camera - 5MP

    Iphone 14 - Face id, iOS - [features - pqr] , scientific calculator, calls
    imesssage[emojis] , findMyLocation, Camera - 8MP

    Iphone 16 - Face id, iOS - [features - xyz] , scientific calculator, calls
    can be recorded,imesssage[emojis] , findMyLocation, Camera - 13MP

    ===>reusability Previous features were also reused and added back so that we dont have
    write the code for it again and again

    /// POLYMORPHISM
    /*
    Poly - many morphism - forms

    one thing could behave differently in diff situation.

    insulators     - rubber, wood
    Semiconductors - in some scenario they conduct elect, in some they restrict
    conduction    - silicon, iron, water

    Method will behave different in diff situation

    Method overloading - Compile time Polymorphism=== already done in method exmple below

    sum(10,20,10) -

    sum(int a, int b);
    sum(int a, int b, int c)

    Method Overriding - Runtime Polymorphism
    thats what we are going to learn under this topic

    ///  ABSTRACTION


   /*
   [Hiding the complex details] from the user and only showing whatever is necessary .

   abstract - some form of idea , overview CAR ------> you need to learn how engine works to drive car

   Mobile phone.

    */
    /// NOTE---> FOR HIDING PART WE USE ABSTRACTION AND ENCAPSULATION


    /// ENCAPSULATION

    /*
    wrapping up the data into single unit

    you are only allowing user to access the data which you only want them to access

    Whatspp ---> status ----> number of users who can see the status

    Profile - lock your profile friend list - you can not access

    Data hiding - Abstraction/ Encapsulation
