    /// NOTE ===> Under Comparator method for toCompare act differently for int data type and String data type



    /// You can’t modify the class
    //If the class you're sorting (like String, Integer, or a third-party class) doesn’t implement Comparable, or you don’t want to change its source code.

    /// You want multiple ways to sort
    // For example, sort products by price, name, or rating — depending on user choice. Comparator lets you write many comparison logics without changing the class itself.

    /// Flexibility
    // You can create separate comparator classes or use lambdas / anonymous inner classes to sort differently in different scenarios.
