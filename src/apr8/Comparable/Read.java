    /// Why we use Comparable

    // Implementing Comparable allows a class to define its own default sorting logic (like by name, id, age, etc.).

    /// Single Comparison Rule
    // If your class only needs one consistent sorting rule, Comparable is a clean, built-in way to apply it.



    /// NOTE=====> method for toCompare act differently for int data type and String data type
